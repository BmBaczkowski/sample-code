Snippets of code for running an online experiment using vanilla javascript and powered by JATOS.

The custom code was made to present image stimuli on the screen and collect participants responses using keyboard and/or mouse input. 
The code (/JS) uses all javascript building blocks (e.g., different types of variables, loops, conditionals, classes, events) as well as asynchrounous methods and operations (e.g., Promises, async, await).

The accompanied html code embeds the javascript in line with JATOS framework.
